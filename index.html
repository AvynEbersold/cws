        <h2>Good Stress</h2>
          <p>
            Stress can be good for you in many ways. When you experience a lot of stress, it is very serious and it can be chronic. (Life long.) Good stress is practically the opposite.
            Good stress can be motivating and may excite you. Good stress can help you reach a goal. 
            With bad stress, it can lead to greater effects like depression, suicidal thoughts, and serious anxiety. But good stress will make you stronger mentally. Good stress includes getting married, having a baby, going to college, buying a house, going on a first date, performing in a play, presenting a slideshow, etc.
            Good stress can work like a vaccine, slowly immuning you over time from worse stress. Say you have to present your thoughts in speech every few weeks in class or work. You’ll be stressed at first, but slowly the stress will die away as you continue. Then, if you ever experience a bigger, scarier, thing, you won’t stress out as much. At least, not as much as if you hadn’t dealt with the eustress. (good stress)

        <h2>Bad Stress</h2>
          <p>
            Bad stress can cause people to miss or even become sick.
            The brain releases chemicals and readies the body for fight-or-flight when distress is encountered.
            Bad stress is the opposite of good stress. While good stress can help you reach a goal, bad stress is a roadblock that can prevent you from reaching it.
            Bad stress can cause people to not be focused or present on the tasks that they are doing in their everyday life. Sometimes it can become chronic, which means it will never totally disappear. Will bad stress, you should seek out a counselor or therapist.
            Employees who have bad stress are 46% more likely to have higher healthcare costs.
            Bad stress can lead to low self-esteem, and threatens focus. If you are in school or at work, it will be much harder to stay focused or on task when stress is overwhelming you.

        <h2>Effects of Stress</h2>
          <p>
            Stress can affect you in a good way or a bad way, including binging.
            There are three main categories of binging.
            Physiological binging is the most popular (common) and it’s just when you eat, drink, or watch TV to distract yourself from tough emotions. But although it seems like this helps, most of the time it makes it worse.
            Chemical bonding is when you just eat and eat and eat because it feels good, and releases a chemical in your brain that tells you, “I feel great!” Chemical binging actually may help for a bit,  but after a while, if you’re a   certain kind of person, you will crave the food or drink more and more until it becomes an addiction.
            Sociocultural binging is when you are not confident in your appearance, behavior or popular status. The pressure of school (or work, sometimes) can lead to extreme binge-eating.
            Sometimes there are other ways your body can deal with stress.
            Stress can positively or negatively impact your performance. Eustress can be motivating but Distress can be very hard to surpass.
            Some of the many ways your body can deal with stress are frequent headaches, increased depression, insomnia, rapid breathing, stomachache, pounding heart, high blood sugar and blood pressure, and very tense muscles.
